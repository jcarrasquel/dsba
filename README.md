### Workshop Log

+ **Workshop 8. Fri 05.02.2021.**
  + Revision of stream classes in C++ (iostream, fstream, string stream)
  + I/O flags in C++. See [here](https://doc.bccnsoft.com/docs/cppreference_en/io_flags.html) for a (not) comprehensive of some I/O flags.
  + More examples with vectors (passing vectors as argument to functions)
  + STL and [algorithm](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/) library.
  + Exercise: Read line-by-line a plain text file. Find all distinct words in a text.
 
+ **Workshop 7. Wed 03.02.2021.**
  + Command-line arguments in QtCreator.
  + Exercises: Code functions to analyze a text file. Counting word frequency in a text. Example with [Tolstoy's War and Peace](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-0.txt).
  + Use of function [find](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/find) for finding substrings in a string.
  + Vectors.

+ **Workshop 6. Fri 29.01.2021.**
  + Separating declaration and implementation of a function.
  + Passing built-in data types to functions by value or by reference using &.
  + Passing arrays to functions. Use of *const* for read-only functions.
  + Passing C-style strings (char arrays) and C++ strings to functions.
  + Reading/writing a file with ifstream and ofstream classes.
  + Relative paths and absolute paths.
  + Configuring working directory in QtCreator.
  
+ **Workshop 5. Wed 27.01.2021.**
  + Reading a whole line (with spaces in-between) into a variable.
  + Use of [isspace](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cctype/isspace/) function.
  + Introduction to [string stream](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/) classes.
  + Exercise: Break down a string into several words separated by a delimiter. See [here](https://github.com/jcarrasquel/dsba/blob/main/ws5-27-01-2021/7-sstream-token.cpp) an example.
