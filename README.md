### Workshop Log

+ **Workshop 10 Fri 12.02.2021.**
  + Quick review on UML diagrams. Behavioral and structural diagrams. Sequence diagrams to show the interaction between C++ functions.

+ **Workshop 9 Wed 10.02.2021.**
  + Exercises on reading data from a CSV file. Example with the [Titanic sample set](https://github.com/jcarrasquel/dsba/blob/main/ws9-10-02-2021/titanic/titanic.csv)

+ **Workshop 8. Fri 05.02.2021.**
  + Revision of stream classes in C++ (iostream, fstream, string stream)
  + I/O flags in C++. See [here](https://doc.bccnsoft.com/docs/cppreference_en/io_flags.html) for a not comprehensive list of some I/O flags.
  + More examples with vectors (passing vectors as argument to functions)
  + STL and [algorithm](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/) library.
  + Exercise: Read line-by-line a plain text file. Find all distinct words in a text.
 
+ **Workshop 7. Wed 03.02.2021.**
  + Command-line arguments in QtCreator.
  + Exercises: Code functions to analyze a text file. Counting word frequency in a text. Example with [Tolstoy's War and Peace](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2600/2600-0.txt).
  + Use of function [find](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/find) for finding substrings in a string.
  + Vectors.

+ **Workshop 6. Fri 29.01.2021.**
  + Separating declaration and implementation of a function.
  + Passing built-in data types to functions by value or by reference using &.
  + Passing arrays to functions. Use of *const* for read-only functions.
  + Passing C-style strings (char arrays) and C++ strings to functions.
  + Reading/writing a file with ifstream and ofstream classes.
  + Relative paths and absolute paths.
  + Configuring working directory in QtCreator.
  
+ **Workshop 5. Wed 27.01.2021.**
  + Reading a whole line (with spaces in-between) into a variable.
  + Use of [isspace](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cctype/isspace/) function.
  + Introduction to [string stream](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/sstream/stringstream/) classes.
  + Exercise: Break down a string into several words separated by a delimiter. See [here](https://github.com/jcarrasquel/dsba/blob/main/ws5-27-01-2021/7-sstream-token.cpp) an example.

+ **Workshop 4. Fri 22.01.2021.** (***Master class in Github and a Git client***)
  + The workshop was recorded, and it is publicly available [here](https://zoom.us/rec/share/ipvZpcizXUqqAfMlbijFKLnpInLKjfkPgOUVNxk2dzdIeY0LdikTFdxIc1lJiu4.P5bUcy7I_wXg1Rdt)!
  + Creating an account in Github, repository creation.
  + Using a git client. Example with [SmartGit](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) (free for non-commercial use in Win/Linux/Apple).
  + Clone, push/commit, branch creation, and merge. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2745076/what-are-the-differences-between-git-commit-and-git-push) an image illustrating the commands.
 
+ **Workshop 3. Wed 20.01.2021.**
  + Loops: for, while, do-while.
  + Break and continue statements.
  + Increment/decrement operators. i++ vs ++i.
  + Conditionals: If/else. Use of the conditional ternary operator ?
  + Switch statement. See [here](https://github.com/jcarrasquel/dsba/blob/main/ws3-20-01-2021/9-switch.cpp) a nice example of creating a command-line menu using a switch statement.

+ **Workshop 2. Fri 15.01.2021.**
  + Continuation of the topics of Workshop 1.
  + Built-in data types in C++.
  + ASCII table and chars in C++
  + C-style strings vs C++ string library.

+ **Workshop 1. Wed 13.01.2021.**
  + Welcoming and introduction to the seminars.
  + Download, installation, and configuration of an IDE, compiler, and cmake build systems. Example with QtCreator.
  + Creating/loading a project in QtCreator.
  + CMakeLists.txt and project structure. Header and implementation files.
  + Hello World! first example in C++
