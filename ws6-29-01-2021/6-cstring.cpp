// 6 passing C-style strings as arguments

/* Recall that a C-style string consists of an array of characters terminated by the null character.
   What youâ€™ve learned about designing array-as-parameter functions applies to string functions too! 

   For example, passing a string as an argument means passing an address, and you can use the 
   "const" to protect a string argument from being altered. */
